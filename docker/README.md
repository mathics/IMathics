# How to use this

In your shell, do:

cd /to/this/folder
docker-compose up

Now use your web browser to go to IP:8888, where IP is "localhost" or "docker-machine ip" if you're running docker machines under OS X or Windows.

That's it.

Be aware that the notebooks you save are saved in your docker images and might be lost at any time.

FIXME: add volumes for persistent notebook saving
